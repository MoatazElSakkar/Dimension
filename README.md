Project Dimension - spring 2018
===============================

Introduction
============

Project dimension is a 3D graphic generation library designed in it's own terms to achieve a degree of similarity to the standard graphic library operations yet introduce a rather different perspective to these operations.

Dimension can produce a test case set of 3 test cases, and can with a few function calls compose, simulate and render a stage of 3D simulated objects; with light processing simulation.

Quick start guide
=================
Project dimension source code is composed of 5 modules and a diagnostic utility, to make use of the actual library you can operate with the API, however to run the tests you could use the diagnostic utility from the same solution.

Note: you may need to set C# Project "Dimension.stub" as StartUp Project in visual studio before the first run.
